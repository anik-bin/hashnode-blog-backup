In a blockchain network, all the information is stored in the form of blocks which are joined together forming a chain of blocks.

If you want to learn more about actually this works, [check out this article](https://blog.aniketbindhani.com/what-is-blockchain-technology-explained).

Blockchain is a decentralised network where all the transactions are transparent. But how do you see all the transactions that are happening?

This is where the role of **<mark>block explorers</mark>** comes into play. Block explorers are like search engines for blockchain networks where you can go and search for transactions that are happening in the blockchain network.

It is a real-time system which shows the current new blocks that are being added to the chain along with a lot of valuable information.

1. Number: It shows the serial number of the block added.
    
2. Hash: This is a unique feature of the blockchain. Each block contains a unique hash code which is a combination of letters and numbers.
    
3. Miner: This shows the name of the miner or the exchange from where it is mined.
    
4. Mined: It shows the time taken to mine the block.
    
5. Tx Count: It shows the number of transactions the block is containing.
    
6. Nonce: NONCE ( number only used once )
    

....and a lot more.

You can check this block explorer for the bitcoin blockchain.

There are different block explorers for different blockchain networks. Ethereum has a different block explorer.

If I click on a block I can see a lot of details to be precise all the details of the particular block. This is a pretty transparent system.
