Before starting this article I want to mention that currently, I am a Computer Science undergrad student who has a dream to become a software engineer in the future.

After completing high school, I have been asked this question a lot of times,
***why did I take up computer science and decided to become a software engineer?***

I come from a family of doctors. My father, mother, and grandfather all are doctors. So naturally, from my childhood, everyone had the expectation that I will become a doctor in the future. As I grew up I realized I had no interest in biology and for becoming a doctor you have to read a lot and studying was my biggest nightmare ðŸ¥²

# How my coding journey started

I had a passion for computers since childhood. When I was very small I would sit beside my brother and watch him use the computer and I used to observe him. Then I would try it myself and in this way, I learned how to use a computer. Then when I was in 10th grade I watched a movie called the social network. I was really inspired by Mark Zuckerberg and his story.

From that movie, I got to know about programming. I was very interested in learning it because I could use it to make cool stuff. You are not going to believe it but the very first project that I thought of making even without having learned to code was a social network like Facebook.

At that point, I didn't know anything about coding. I started searching on YouTube, about how to make a social network. I got some tutorials and I found out that to make a social site you need to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and a lot more. I started learning about HTML and PHP. Since making a social site is no joke, I got confused and left the project. But I kept learning how to code.

After completing high school, I had to make a decision about whether I should go to engineering or medical school. I choose engineering and I took computer science.

# Coding in College

After coming to college, I got to know about various topics in Computer Science. In my freshman year, we had common subjects like physics, and chemistry which I really hated.

Instead of focussing on those, I started reading about computers and how they work. I learned new languages. I got to know about hackathons, I participated in them. I discovered open source. After my freshman year, I was fully sure that I want to make my career in computer science.

Currently, I am in my 3rd year. One more year is left till I graduate. I will update this article from time to time. This was my submission for the 4 Articles in 4 Weeks - Hashnode Writeathon. #4articles4weeks #week1
